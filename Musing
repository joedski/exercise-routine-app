Exercise App

Sections: (probably shown by tabs.)
	All Exercises:
		Shows all items.
		Items each show their catagories.
		Items each show the appropriate seat/etc and weight settings
		Items each have the option to edit settings, etc.
	Daily Routine:
		Selects 5 items, one from each of the categorise:
			Items cannot be the same as they were in the last full-re-roll of the Daily Routine.
			Items should prefer having all their catagories unique, but only the specified catagories actually must be unique.
				Thus, although multiple machines may specify 'glutes' as a catagory, they will not exclude based on it, though it may factor into a lower preference.
		Items each show their catagories.
		Items each show the appropriate seat/etc and weight settings
		Items each have the option to edit settings, etc.
		Items each have the option to reroll that one (that particular machine may be occupied.)
		Items have a check-toggle always visible to indicate completion.
		Rerolling the Daily Routine requires a confirmation from a popup box.

Dropbox Integration:
	Stores current settings and exercise machines.
	Also used to track progress.

When to reroll:
---------------

This obviously only applies until we actually start writing things back to Dropbox.

- When the first fetch is made (or, essentially, when we have no data already saved.)
- When a fetch is forced. (i.e. when refresh is called.)
